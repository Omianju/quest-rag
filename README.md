# AI-Powered PDF Chat

Welcome to **AI-Powered PDF Chat** ‚Äì an advanced platform that enables seamless, interactive conversations with PDF documents. Designed for convenience and efficiency, this project leverages **TypeScript**, **tRPC**, **Uploadthings**, **Kinde authentication**, **vector embedding**, and **LangChain.js** to create a powerful, secure, and scalable tool for extracting knowledge from PDF content with high precision.

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered Interaction**: Engage in meaningful, interactive conversations directly with PDF files. The AI parses and contextualizes document content, offering responsive and relevant answers in real time.
- **Precision with Vector Embeddings**: Utilizing vector embeddings to deliver accurate responses based on PDF content, ensuring nuanced and contextually relevant answers.
- **Built with LangChain.js**: Harnessing LangChain.js for efficient and structured conversational flows, enhancing the AI's ability to handle complex document interactions.
- **Secure Access Control**: Integrated with **Kinde** for robust user authentication, ensuring a secure and personalized experience for each user.
- **Efficient Document Uploading**: Powered by **Uploadthings**, document uploads are managed smoothly and efficiently, supporting various file types with ease.
- **TypeScript & tRPC for Robustness**: **TypeScript** ensures type safety and scalability, while **tRPC** facilitates seamless client-server communication, streamlining the architecture for better performance and maintainability.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **Backend**: Built with **tRPC**, facilitating efficient API calls and real-time interactions with the AI.
- **Frontend**: **TypeScript** ensures a strong, type-safe client that communicates effectively with the server.
- **Authentication**: Managed by **Kinde** to secure user sessions and ensure smooth, personalized interactions.
- **File Uploads**: **Uploadthings** handles document management, providing an intuitive and secure file upload process.
- **Vector Embeddings & LangChain.js**: Using LangChain.js and vector embeddings to achieve accurate, context-aware responses tailored to the content of each PDF.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

1. **Optimizing AI Response Accuracy**: Crafting responses that accurately reflect the nuances of the PDF content was challenging. Vector embeddings, combined with LangChain.js, were used to balance precision with natural language flow.
2. **Ensuring Scalable Authentication**: Implementing Kinde for secure and scalable authentication involved fine-tuning for performance and robust user session management.
3. **Handling Large PDF Files**: Managing file size limitations and optimizing upload efficiency to ensure quick response times, especially for larger PDFs, required integrating efficient file handling solutions.
4. **Maintaining Type Safety Across the Stack**: With TypeScript as the backbone, maintaining type integrity across components and ensuring compatibility between the client and server in tRPC was essential but required meticulous type management.
